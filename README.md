# simple_kafka_exercise
A simple kafka exercise on producer and consumer creation, from Chapter 13 of Paul Crickard's textbook: Data Engineering with Python. 
After starting up zookeeper and a kafka cluster on your machine, and sucessfully running both the producer and consumer python scripts,
you should be able to see something similar to what I got in the fixtures folder.

(Side note: The faker module generates random/mock data which is passed by the producer to the kafka cluster, so don't be alarmed if your results
don't match mine entirely)
